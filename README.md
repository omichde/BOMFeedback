# BOMFeedback

A general iOS feedback modul, which helps to show most APP informations, get in contact with the user, promote positiv APP ratings and other stuff - think of it as a more elaborated but concise AboutMe dialog.

The idea behind this package is to free you as a developer from those tedious administrative areas within your APP (about, copyright, user contact) and at the same time motivate users to positive reviews: it starts with a simple question, wether the user likes that APP (and hence could give a positiv review or like to share it) or in case of problems provides a FAQ/email contact.

# Features

- every modul can be switched on/off in the config file
- selection of "sharing services" (APP Store rating deep link, email, twitter, facebook)
- every text output can be localized
- custom icon font for (tab bar) symbols, zero images used
- support for iOS 13 DarkMode, UIAppearance savvy
- runs modally or as a form sheet
- self-contained, no extra dependencies
- one storyboard, all AutoLayout, full rotation support
- local or server-based FAQ with auto-updating
- embedding for custom subviewcontroller (i.e. for IAP restauration)

# Installation

Copy the `BOMFeedback` folder from the `niceapp` sample into your project (no pod jet). BOMFeedback is configured using a property list file and uses localizations from different subfiles.

# Documentation

## Contact modul

This is the core and initial modul. It simply starts with the question if the user likes the APP or not. In case he likes it, he'll be invited to submit a review in the APP store and/or share an APP link to others. In case there is a problem, a FAQ is displayed and an email button to get in contact with you.

`submodule` - classname of a custom subviewcontroller, optional. If you want to display further information about your APP in the contact modul or an APP store purchase restoring feature, this might be the right place.

`email` - email address to be used in the contact sheet (info@getniceapp.com)

`services` - comma separated list of services: store, email, twitter, facebook

`faq` - in case the user has a problem, a FAQ will be displayed which either comes locally  preinstalled or is loaded from your server
